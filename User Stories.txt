As a user, I would like to...

Log in, and know I am logged in
Log out, and know I am logged out
View nav-bar on every page, preferrably collapsible
View a list of my characters
Create a new character
Edit an existing character
Delete a character
Export a character sheet as a downloadable file (image?, pdf?)
Open a character sheet for quick play
Use online dice roller with reactive sheet to roll checks on the fly easily
Make a form to create objects (e.g. creating an ability, entering custom races, etc.)


"The idea I have is a reactive table style form that has every check in a quick access table that you can roll on with easy modifications and hopefully applying effects from a certain item or racial bonus or whatever automatically"
